<h1>gcoville's Retrochallenge 2011 Winter Warmup project</h1>
<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>
This page describes my efforts restoring a Heathkit ET-3400 microprocessor
trainer along with a similar model, a Heathkit ET-3400A.  This was part of
the Retrochallenge 2011 Winter Warmup that occurred from Jan 1, 2011 to
Jan 31, 2011.  The Retrochallenges are designed to get retrocomputing
enthusiasts to actually spend time doing what they like to do: mess about
with old computers.
</p>
<p>
My project was one of three winners.  One winner was
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130205010709/http://paleoferrosaurus.com/rcww2011.html">Paleoferrosaurus</a> who
did a nifty project stabilizing the video output from a Apple II so that
it could be recorded properly on high-end video equipment.  (I stole a
bit of his code for my final demo.)  The other winner was
<a href="http://aliennerd.wordpress.com/2011/01/">Aliennerd</a> who
created a new inform-based text adventure game based on the film "Silent
Running."  Aliennerd's game was demonstrated to be playable on at least
two of the other constestant's text adventure runtime environments.
Several of the entries were really quite cool and I encourage you to
check out the entire array of candidates.  Visit the

<p>
I had been considering entering the
<a href="http://retrochallenge.org/">RetroChallenge</a>
2011 Winter Warmup "contest" for a while, but there didn't seem to be any
activity around it getting organized.  Then at the last minute, a volunteer
(urbancamo) put it together.  I've decided to commit and have sent in my entry.
My goal is fairly simple:
</p>
<pre>
I'm going to fix up my Heathkit ET-3400 and ET-3400A microprocessor trainers.

<p>
The contest runs from Jan 1, 2011 through Jan 31, 2011.  I'll post more info
on this project once the contest begins.

Okay, we're off and running.  This website is still pretty bare-bones.  Click on a picture for a higher-rez version of it.
</p>
<p>
The first thing I needed to do was clean up
some workspace.  Here's a "before" shot:
</p>
<p>
<a href="workbench_before.jpg"><img src="workbench_before_sm.jpg" alt=""></a>
</p>
<p>
Quick list of what you see: phone, HP-41CX, 23" Cinema Display,
27" iMac (quad-i7 2.8Ghz), ipod touch, eeepc, RLX blade server with several
blades in it, a vintage ISA video card, ethernet cables, dog bed.
The RLX box is practically retro now, vintage is 2001 or so.
It's identical to the one at the colo which is hosting my website and
other stuff and I need to do a remote upgrade.
It's going to be somewhat tricky so I'm using this one as a staging/test box.
(That project is going to have to go on hold for a bit during the winter
warmup.)  If you look closely, there's a Jelly Belly jelly-bean near the
wire cutters.  Just thought you should know.

<h3>2011-01-02</h3>
<h4>Assessment and some history:</h4>
<p>
I'm going to start with the ET-3400.  I am the original owner.  My older
brother and I purchased the kit in November 1977.  I was 13 and he was 18.
He must have been back at home from first year of college for Thanksgiving.
I had plenty of experience building Heathkits at that point, so I put it
together.
Our dad worked for TWA and that year I travelled across the country several
times with it in my carryon luggage so that I could show my bro what I had
learned and fun little programs we could do on it.  I definitely got more
out of the ET-3400 than he did, as he had quite a bit of experience with
PDP-11s and some other microprocessors already.  Heathkit also had a course
that went with it, the EE-3401 Individual Learning Program in Microprocessors.
I went through the lessons and exercises religiously.
</p>
<p>
The ET-3400 is a small computer based around the Motorola 6800 8-bit CPU.
It has 512 bytes of RAM, 1024 bytes of ROM with a simple monitor program in
it, 6 seven-segment LED displays, and a hex keypad.  However, the really
cool things is that enough of the CPU's address, data, and control lines
are exposed and there's a prototyping block available.  There are 8 convenient
LEDs that you can light up for whatever you want, and an 8-position dip
switch for setting some other inputs.  It was amazingly simple to add
circuitry to the computer to try out interfacing to some new gizmo.
</p>
<p>
Many, many years ago, I was noodling around with the ET-3400 and I noticed that
the "1Hz" output wasn't operating properly.  This doesn't affect the operation
of the computer any.  It's just a signal that's provided for convenience.
It's not even really 1 Hz.  It's the output of a RC op-amp
circuit that's "close" to 1 Hz.  I remember way back that doing any serious
timing with it was a mistake.  For serious timing, it was better to use the
60hz signal which was based on the AC line frequency.  Anyway, I've just
checked by attaching a wire from the 1Hz signal to one of the handy LED inputs,
and sure enough, this is still inop.
</p>
<p>
More recently, I took the unit out of storage and I tried playing with it.
Unfortunately, the "1" key doesn't seem to work properly anymore.  It seems
like it's just not making contact.  This is a show-stopper, because that's
needed to change the A accumulator if you're playing with ROM monitor, and
it's also needed to enter in any value that has a 1 in it.  Since all input
is in machine language, you just can't get very far before you need to type
a "1".
</p>
<p>
Another problem is that when you open up the device, the power-supply's
transformer is on the bottom case, and the main circuit board is on the
top case.  I've had this thing open so many times over the years that
one of the wires on the transformer keeps breaking.  Several times I've
had to reattach it to the circuit board, each time it gets a bit shorter,
making the problem worse.  As you can see from this picture, it's broken
again:
</p>
<p>
<a href="broken_red_wire.jpg"><img src="broken_red_wire_sm.jpg" alt=""></a>
</p>
<p>
Note the fine soldering.  It looks like it was done by a 13-year-old!
</p>
<p>
Looking at the schematic, this is part of the 12V section of the power
supply.  It doesn't affect the computer operation, because 12V isn't used
anywhere.  Like the 1Hz signal, these +12V/-12V supplies are provided as
a convenience for the circuit experimentor.  They're very handy if you're
doing voltage conversions for serial ports (this was all before the MAX-232
type serial interfaces) or interfacing to some of those really old TI EPROMS.  
</p>
<p>
I've checked the 12V and -12V external supplies and found something
pretty amazing.  Even with this broken red wire, I'm still getting a pretty
decent 12V and -12V supply.  It's a standard full-wave bridge, but 1/2 of
the input it gone.  I expect there's a bit of a ripple in the outputs, but
I haven't hooked up a scope to them.  The +12V supply is showing 12.11 VDC
and .011 VAC.  The -12V supply is showing -11.88 VDC and .087 VAC.
Both w/ 1 Kohm load.  We'll see what these values are once the red wire is
reattached.
</p>
<h4>Summary:</h4>
<p>
For the ET-3400, I want to do the following things:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Figure out and fix the "1" key.</li>
<li>Fix the 1Hz external signal.</li>
<li>Fix the red transformer wire.  Maybe make all the transformer wires easily detachable.</li>
<li>Clean it up a bit.  It's got a layer of dust on it.  In the corners, too.</li>
<li>Wire up something reasonably cool to it.  I don't know what yet.</li>
<li>Write up some little program for it.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2011-01-03</h3>
<p>
The ET-3400's main circuit board is attached to the top half of the plastic
shell.  Many of the components are visible, but some are hidden behind the
upper part of the shell (behind the black label with the power switch, etc.).
The IC at the heart of the 1Hz signal is hidden up there.
</p>
<p>
I detached the board from the top shell and looked for IC18, the quad
comparator that uses one of its comparators in the 1Hz circuit.
(Oops, not an op amp that I had remembered in my earlier post, but close.)
</p>
<p>
This is what I find:
</p>
<p>
<a href="1hz_problem.jpg"><img src="1hz_problem_sm.jpg" alt=""></a>
</p>
<p>
I have no idea why those pins are bent up like that.  I have absolutely no
recollection of doing it but it must have been me.  I can think of two
scenarios.  Something is wrong with the quad comparator, and for some
reason taking that single unit out of the circuit allows the other one
to function properly.  (Two of the comparators aren't used.)  OR, more likely,
I was messing around with RC circuits trying to get the signal closer to 1Hz.
The part is a Nat Semi LM2901N.  It should be a simple matter of extracting
it, restoring the pins to their regular positions, and trying it out.
</p>
<p>
And while detaching the top shell, another wire from the transformer to the
circuit board broke off.  This time the center tap for the 5V supply.  Until
I get that reattached, I won't be trying out any sort of 1Hz or "1" key
fixes.  These tranformer wires are getting out of hand. I'm definitely going
to install some sort of connector for them.
</p>
<p>
I live in a somewhat rural town, and there's not a whole lot of local
choices for electronics parts.  However, I did take a look in the local
Radio Shack.  I picked up a LM339 quad comparator and a male/female
set of molex-style 6-pin power connectors.  The LM339 should be a good enough
replacement for the LM2901N, just in case it actually is faulty.  The power
connectors are going on the transformer outputs.
</p>
<p>
That's all for today.  Enjoy this snapshot of my faithful assistant taking
a break:

Today was my first day back at the day job this new year, plus my S.O.'s
birthday.  There was no time to do retrocomputing and restoration.

Since this "blog" doesn't use regular blogging software, there's no ability
to leave comments.  It's not that I don't want to hear from you, I just don't
want to run blogging software.  Therefore, I have created a special email
address where you can reach me and if you'd like I'll post your comments.
If you do write, be sure to specify if you want your comment posted or not.
The address is <a href="mailto:rc2011ww@gc.org">rc2011ww@gc.org</a>.  Since
this is out in the open, it will get harvested and get tons of spam
eventually.  Therefore, I'll disable it at the end of the winter warmup.
After that, I can be contacted in a bunch of other ways.  (It's not difficult
to find out a valid email address for me.  You could do a whois on me, or
there's even a puzzle elsewhere on this website to find one.)

<h3>2011-01-05</h3>
<p>
I made progress today.  I'm working on the problem of the transformer
wires connecting to the circuit board always breaking.  I found a pretty
good place to attach a molex connector on the circuit board of the ET-3400.
Actually, it's the only part of the machine that could be considered a chassis.
I soldered the ends of the wires on the transformer to the pins.
I also soldered the pins to wires to go to the connecter on the chassis, but
that side isn't done yet -- I still need to connect those wires to the
circuit board itself.
</p>
<p>
Here's where the power connecter will go on the chassis:
</p>
<p>
<a href="power_connector_placement.jpg"><img src="power_connector_placement_sm.jpg" alt=""></a>
</p>
<p>
Right now, it's attached by a zip-tie.  It slides around a bit, so I may use
an adhesive as well.
</p>
<p>
Inserting some pins into the connector on the transformer side:
</p>
<p>
<a href="inserting_pins.jpg"><img src="inserting_pins_sm.jpg" alt=""></a>
</p>
<p>
I love that "click".
</p>
<p>
Final shot of the transformer connector:
</p>
<p>
<a href="transformer_connector_done.jpg"><img src="transformer_connector_done_sm.jpg" alt=""></a>
</p>
<p>
An initial attempt to line up this connector with the other connector shows
that there is enough length here to reach when everything's all assembled.
I was worried about that for a moment.
</p>
<hr>
<h3>2011-01-06</h3>
<p>
Major success this evening!  I finished the power connector.  It's working
quite well.  The +12V output is: 12.14 VDC .001 VAC.
The -12V output is: -11.87 VDC .086 VAC.  So apparently less ripple on the
+12V output and not much change on the -12V output.  I can live with that.
Plus, my soldering-power-wires-to-the-circuit-board days are over.
</p>
<p>
On the advice of Leo from the et-3400 group (Yahoo Groups), I put DeoxIT
DN5 down the shaft of the "1" key.  (Actually, Leo suggested DeoxIT D5,
but DN5 was what I found in Radio Shack.)
After a while of repeatedly pressing the key, it works perfectly.
One key press, one "1" registers!
</p>
<p>
As for the 1Hz signal, I straightened out the pins on the LM2901N and
reseated it.  No go.  That part is definitely faulty.  I then put in my
substitute LM339N, and I've got a pulse!  It's a little weird, though.
About 26 in one minute (~ 1/2 Hz), and the duty cycle seems to be on
about 80%, off 20%.  I don't recall the signal being quite that
inaccurate back in the day, so maybe I'll order a 2901 from
mail-order and check it out later.
</p>
<p>
So, that covers the three main problems with the ET-3400.  I'll put some
time into beautification, then I'm not sure if I'll dive right into the
ET-3400A or play with the ET-3400 a bit.  Maybe I should reconnect
with my 6800 machine code days.  I've forgotten all the opcodes.  Back
in the day I had most of them memorized.
</p>
<p id="powerconnectorfinished">
Here's a shot of the power connector all finished.  Two zip ties hold it
in place quite well.  The center taps off the tranformer outputs are both tied
to ground, so instead of running wires over to where they used to connect,
I soldered them to a lug and screwed it to the chassis.  Those are the black
wires.

does indicate that a whole lot of things are working properly:

<p>
I spent a little time cleaning up the ET-3400.  It doesn't look new, but it
does look quite a bit better now.  I wasn't planning to post a picture,
thinking the change wouldn't be that much when viewed on the screen.  But
when you compare the pic with the one from Jan 1, you really can see a
difference.  I also completely reassembled it, even committing to putting
back all the screws in the casing.
</p>
<p>

<h3>2011-01-08</h3>
<p>
I haven't come up with a supercool thing to hook up to my ET-3400 or some
nifty little program to write.  So in order to make progess, I started
fixing up the ET-3400A.  Almost all the keys had difficulty with not
making contact or bouncing pretty bad and giving two or three "presses"
for each real press.  I treated each keyswitch's post to DeoxIT DN5 and let
the fluid run down into the mechanism.  Then after pressing all the keys
quite a few times, they came to life properly.  I'm quite impressed with
the DeoxIT product.  I also cleaned the keycaps so they're quite spiffy now.
</p>
<p>
The whole ET-3400A is dusty.  It also has a strange odor to it.  I
purchased this unit off ebay in spring 2010.  It seemed like a nice kit
and had been well cared for.  But it came in a suitcase-like thing made of
a thin plastic, which over the years had started to break down and was quite
musty.  When I received the ET-3400A, the documentation that came with it
(schematic, manual, and the books and tapes for the EE-3401 course), and
a few parts, I immediately threw away the carrying case.  It was that bad.
Anyway, this odor still lingers on the unit.  I'm hoping that when I get
to cleaning the dust off it and wiping it down carefully, the smell goes
away mostly.
</p>
<hr>
<h3>2011-01-09</h3>
<p>
I finished cleaning up the ET-3400A.  I am going to declare it done now.
I had been considering doing the same trick to the wires from the transformer
for this one as the ET-3400, but I decided against it.  First, all the
wires appeared to be in good shape and none were broken.  Second, the ET-3400A
has a grounded 3-conductor power cord, as opposed to the ET-3400's
two-conductor non-grounded power cord.  In the ET-3400A, the ground wire
connects to the transformer and they added a fairly beefy wire braid from
there to a big ground pad on the circuit board.  I would want to preserve
that connection, so would need a different connector than I used on the
ET-3400.  Again, since there really isn't a problem here, I figured its
best to leave it alone.
</p>
<p>
Here's a picture of the cleaning in progress, note the difference between
the "Data I/O" section and the "Control Buffers" section.

<h3>2011-01-10</h3>
<p>
I have started refamiliarizing myself with the 6800 and the ET-3400 from a
programming point of view.  I tried out a simple example from the manual
which sequentially displays each segment of the 6 seven-segment LEDs.  It
worked, but it isn't very satisfying because I didn't write it.  I just typed
in a bunch of machine code.
</p>
<p>
To start, I am going to make a simple clock app.  There's an example in the
manual, but I don't like it because 1) It's based on the CPU clock speed
and you adjust a parameter based on whether it runs fast or slow.  2) If
you reset the board, the clock stops.
</p>
<p>
My improved clock program will require a very simple circuit: a single wire
from the 60Hz line (based on the AC line frequency, 60Hz here in the US) to
the non-maskable interrupt input.  The interrupt handler will keep track of
the time, and a main routine will display it.  If I hit the reset button
(and don't hold it down too long), the NMI will keep ticking and keeping
time, so I can resume the display part later.  I did some experiments with
the user NMI vector and verified that the ROM monitor works just fine
with the NMI ticking away.
</p>
<hr>
<h3>2011-01-11</h3>
<p>
The clock exercise was a success.  It's a rudimentary 24-hour clock.
</p>
<p id="clockexercise">
Here's what it looks like:
</p>
<p>
<a href="et-3400_clock.jpg"><img src="et-3400_clock_sm.jpg" alt=""></a>
</p>
<p>
If you happen to look at the exif data for the picture, you'll see that
it was taken at 21:28:10, yet the clock itself says 21:28:31.  The
heathkit clock is actually the correct one.  The exif data is set from
my camera's internal clock, which is apparently about 20 seconds slow.
</p>
<p>
The clock works by taking the line frequency (60Hz in the US) and feeding
it into the non-maskable interrupt input.  The interrupt vector for the
6800's NMI is in the ROM, but fortunately the authors of the ET-3400 ROM
monitor were kind enough to point that vector to a place in RAM, so that
experimentors like me can attach to it.  The NMI handler does all the
math of incrementing the HZ tick count, then seconds, then minutes, then
hours appropriately if there's a rollover.  I keep the time values in
BCD because it's just easier to input the time and for displaying, I can
just call a ROM monitor routine to chuck three hex bytes out to the displays.
To set the time, I just edit the values in RAM.  I can even do this while
the ticks are running.
</p>
<p>
A more correct way would have been to keep the interrupt handler as small
and quick as possible.  That would mean to have the tick increment a value,
roll it over at 60*60*60*24.  The display routine would have to be more
complicated, taking the tick value from the start of the day, dividing and
getting remainders for the seconds, minutes, hours.  The 6800 doesn't have
a divide instruction and at this point I'm too lazy to write one or dig one
up.  Plus setting the time would require more code, because editing the raw
counter value would be a pain.
</p>
<p>
Here's the code.  If you notice any syntax errors and wonder how on earth
I got it to assemble, the answer is that this was hand-assembled.  Before
I go find an assembler for 6800 that I can work with, I though it would
be therapeutic to generate the machine code by hand just once.  It really
helped me refamiliarize with the 6800 architecture and limitations.

The NMI ISR (at 0108) runs through a loop incrementing tick counts, seconds,
minutes, or hours.  The appropriate roll-over values are kept in an array
right after the time values, and the ISR uses the index register to access
the time value (x) or its rollover value (x+4).  In the 6800, the decimal
adjust is the BCD magic to keep these values looking like decimal.  I have
to add 1 using the add instruction because the daa command doesn't work
after a simple increment.
</p>
<p>
The display portion of the program at 0000 makes use of two routines in the
ET-3400's ROM monitor.  There's a display pointer keeping track of which
LED to write to next, and a display routine with dumps a bunch of bytes
onto the displays, translating them from their hex values to the special
display codes for the 7-segments.
</p>
<p>
Note to any ET-3400 users out there who are trying this.  Do not connect
the wire from the Line output to the NMI input until <b>after</b>
you have finished entering the program, or at least the ISR part from 00fd
through 0120.
</p>
<p>
I'm going to leave my clock running for a day or so, just to see how it
goes.
</p>

<h3>2011-01-12</h3>
<p>
I didn't want to get too obsessed with the clock program because it was
supposed to be just a warmup for something more interesting.  However I
noticed this morning that the time on the clock wasn't quite right.  It had
drifted from the clock I set it to the night before.  In fact, last night
it seemed it had gone fast then this morning too slow.  Not by much, only
a fraction of a second difference after several hours, I'm quite confused
about this.  I then realized that the reference clock was the clock in the
corner of my iMac, and that might drift and get corrected by NTP at
who-knows-when intervals.  So I started to compare it to the clock display
in a Garmin GPS.  The Heathkit clock was definitely going too fast for the
period I was watching it.
</p>
<p>
I'm now running a very simple timing test to ensure that my 60hz signal is
really 60hz.  The ISR is simply bumping up a 32-bit counter.  I noted the time
(on the GPS) when I started it. I'll let it run overnight and note the time I
stop it by pulling the wire to the NMI.  I should be able to calculate exactly
how many ticks there were, plus or minus about 20.  If I see more error
than that, then I'll know that the 60hz signal isn't to be trusted and
simply move on.  If the 60hz signal is trustworthy, then I don't know what
I'll do.
</p>
<p>
I have considered the possibility that the interrupt service routine is
taking too long and not completing before it's invoked again.  That would
be bad, as the code is definitely not reentrant-safe.  Usually, you don't
worry about these things because the speed of the cpu is orders of magnitude
faster than a huge 1/60 of a second.  But is it in this case?  I honestly
don't know yet.  I don't know the exact speed of my cpu, nor have I calculated
how long the ISR takes in the worst-case scenario when the hours roll over.
When I'm done testing the speed of the 60hz line, I'll do an experiment to
determine the clock speed of my 6800.  On the ET-3400, the clock circuit is
driven by an RC circuit, not by a crystal oscillator.  So there's always a
bit of variation from one unit to the next.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, I have located and built the "asl" assembler on my Mac.
This is one amazing piece of software.  It can assemble code for dozens of
different cpus.  (Right now I'm interested in the 6800 but I've got
dozens of future projects on other micros.)  I managed to convert my clock
program to its syntax without too much modification!

This will really help with the experiments.  Funny, I never used an
assembler back in the day.  I just hand-assembled everything.  Now I don't
seem to have the patience for it.  I'll probably also start working on
some faster way to load these programs into memory rather than keying them
in.

I let the 60hz-NMI counter run for 19 hours.  I was expecting somewhere
around 4104000 ticks.  I got 4104047 ticks.  That's about 3/4 of a second
gain in 19 hours.  Some of that is can be explained away with perhaps
sloppy human start/stop actions, but probably not 3/4 of a second.  For now,
I'm just going to say that the 60hz signal isn't good enough by itself for
time keeping.  I should probably let the thing run for a week to know for
sure what the drift is on the "60hz" line, but that will have to wait.
I want to do other stuff on the ET-3400.
</p>
<p>
I was curious what the clock speed or cycle time is on my ET-3400.  So
I did a test that counts.  After a set time, I stop the count and see
where it is.

The comments are the number of cpu cycles that each instruction takes.  I
keep the count in a 32-bit value, so there's a branch to increment the
upper half of the value.  But doing that would affect the duration of the
loop.  I added "nop" instructions to the non-branching path to even out the
duration.  The loop time is constant regardless of whether the upper
half of the value is incremented or not.
</p>
<p>
On the ET-3400, I got 576670 loops in 420 seconds.  That's 12563.5 loops/sec.
At 32 cpu cycles per loop, that gives 402032 cycles/sec.  I recall something
about the cpu cycle being 1/2 the cpu frequency.  So, this is about right.
</p>
<p>
On the ET-3400A, I got 7263338 loops in 240 seconds.  That results in 968445
cycles/sec.  About twice as fast as the ET-3400.  That sounds about right.
</p>
<p>
I didn't calculate the time of the NMI ISR routine in the clock program, but
I definitely wasn't exceeding 6700 cycles (1/60th of a second) to execute
that routine.  So that wasn't the issue.  It was just the inaccuracy of the
60hz signal.
</p>
<p>
I figure I'm done messing about with timing.  My next goal is to make it so
I can write slightly longer programs and get them into the machines without
having to key them in by hand.  I want to wire up a serial port and feed the
output of the asl assembler directly to the machine.  Step 1 is locating the
parts I'll need.  I know I've got the official Mot 6850 "ACIA" (Asyncronous
Communications Interface Adapter) around here somewhere.  Here's a picture of
the mess I made looking for the parts:
</p>
<p>
<a href="parts_mess.jpg"><img src="parts_mess_sm.jpg" alt=""></a>
</p>
<p>
I found a 6850.  This was the one that originally came with the Heathkit
EE-3402 Microprocessor Interfacing course I purchased a few years after my
initial encounter with the ET-3400.  I found a second 6850 which I don't
remember acquiring, but it's definitely different.  It's a ceramic chip,
instead of the familiar plastic.  I don't know if it works.  It would be
good to have two.  I could hook one to each of the boards.  OR, I'm likely
to have both on the ET-3400A (which has 2x the memory for a total of 1k
bytes!).  With two serial ports, I could have one connected to the Mac for
downloading programs, and one connected to my next trick.  Which is ...
</p>
<p>
I dusted off (literally!) an HP 7475A pen plotter that I've been carrying
around for years.  I rescued this from a hallway pile of junk-to-be-thrown-out
at IBM Boca Raton in 1992.  Soon after I rescued it, I had to purchase a pen
carousel and manuals.  Every few years, I buy a batch of pens thinking I'm
going to do something with this plotter.  From the last batch, I have 8
working pens.  I've got some colors, but the black ones are all dried up.
HP doesn't sell pens for these any more, but there are other suppliers.
I'd like to connect the plotter to the ET-3400A and plot something nice.

<h3>2011-01-14</h3>
<p>
I have located some more parts for the upcoming serial interface.  I found a
74LS138 TTL demuxer and a MC1489 RS232-to-TTL level converter amongst my pile
of parts.  I didn't find a MC1488, so this will be a receive-only serial
interface for a while until I find a 1488.  I went to Fry's today in
Sacramento and picked up a couple male db9 connectors.  I'll solder
a few wires onto one and connect to a USB-serial port on the Mac.
</p>
<p>
I'll build the serial interface circuit tomorrow.  I haven't figured out
yet what clock frequency it'll need, but I've got a bunch of clock oscillator
components.  One of them should do the trick.
</p>

<h3>2011-01-15</h3>
<p>
We have a serial port!  I wired up the 6850 ACIA and did some testing.  I
spent quite a while thinking the whole thing was broken when I could not get
any data on the transmit line.  I then continued testing everything else
which all works just fine.  I must have fried the transmitter output at some
point in the past on this chip.  However, I just decided to focus on the
current goal which is to get a serial port that receives so I can download
programs easier.  The interface is receiving data from my Mac quite well.
</p>
<p id="serialin">
Here's a picture:
</p>
<p>
<a href="serial_port_1.jpg"><img src="serial_port_1_sm.jpg" alt=""></a>
</p>
<p>
On the proto board on the main unit is the MC1488 level converter, the 6850
ACIA, a 74LS138 3-to-8 demux, and a 7410 triple-input nand gate.  On the
lower proto board is my clock circuit: a 7404 with a 5.0Mhz crystal and some
resistors, and a 7473 flipflop to divide the signal down by 2.  To the left
is the db9 connected to a USB-serial adapter which goes to the Mac.  The
demux is connected to Address lines A15 through A10.  The 0th output lights
up at address 2000h, the 1st output at 2400h, etc.  I have the ACIA mapped
at 2000h.  The 7410 is for glue logic.  On this computer, the data lines are
available, but they're protected by a directional buffer.  That directional
control is turned on and off by the "RE-" signal way at the top of the board.
We wouldn't need this if we were hooked right into the data bus, but here on
the outside we need some glue to set the direction of the external data bus.
</p>
<p>
The clock frequency was a bit of a challenge.  I didn't have such a large
selection of crystals and crystal oscillators as I had thought.  The 6850
ACIA can take the input clock and divide it by 1, 16, or 64.  I found a 5Mhz
crystal, set up the circuit for it, and divide it by two.  If I set up the
ACAI to divide by 64, then I get 5.0Mhz / 2 / 64 = 39062.5, which is only 1.7%
different from 38400 baud.  It's not great, but it's close enough.  I did
find a 6.144 Mhz crystal, which when divided by 10, and then use the /16 in
the ACIA would give 38400 exactly.  Unfortunately, I don't have the right
part hanging around to divide by 10.

<p>
The program is quite simple:

What you see on the display is hex 30.  I had just pressed a "0" in my
zterm program on the Mac.
</p>
<p>
I didn't get as far today as I would have liked.  I was hoping to get to the
point where I could download the ouput of the assembler on the Mac to the
ET-3400A.  I've got all the pieces working, but there's a bit of programming
to do.
</p>
<p>
I go on business travel tomorrow and won't be back until Friday so I probably
won't be able to work on the project until then.  While I'm away, I may try to
find a free circuit drawing program so I can show what's really going on
with the serial port circuit in the picture above.

I'm out of town and not able to play with my boards, but I've been learning
what I can about the asl assembler.  I'm preparing for when I return and
start wanting to download assembled output directly to the ET-3400A.  asl
output is in a "p" file which is not straight binary output.  Because asl
is an assembler for multiple processors, the p files have all sorts of
information in them that I don't want.  There is a p2hex program that can
convert the raw output to a variety of formats, including Motorola S records.
However, one goal for my downloading project is the receiving program has
to be dead simple because that part I'm going to have to key in by hand
every time I unplug the board.  I may end up using the p2bin program instead.
That is intended for preparing p files to be burned to eproms.
</p>
<p>
I've been wondering what my options are in getting some sort of free C
compiler working for the 6800 board.  It turns out that I'm at a company
meeting where that are at least 2 dozen very smart gcc compiler engineers.
I got plenty of suggestions: Small C, LCC, and SDCC.  I took a look at
these and I think I'll try to give SDCC a whirl.  It builds on MacOS X
(in fact, they even deliver a binary for MacOS X).  It also targets a
few 8-bit cpus, one of which is 68HC08.  Off-hand, I don't recall how
different the 68HC08 is from the 6800 that's on my boards, but even if
it's not the same, I might be able to hack on the compiler to retarget
it for 6800.
</p>
<hr>
<h3>2011-01-20</h3>
<p>
I'm still out of town.  I played around with the sdcc C compiler a bit.
It can target the 68hc08, however that's not going to be much help.  After
doing some research, I found that the hc08 is similar to the 6800, but there
are enough differences that make any code for the hc08 unusable on a 6800.
sdcc is definitely a cool package, though.  There is a compiler, assembler,
linker, and simulator.  It is possible to retarget the compiler to the
6800 which I hope to do someday, but that's going to be a much bigger
effort than I want to get involved with during this winter warmup.
</p>
<p>
For high-level-like programming, I will be using the macro capabilities
in the asl assembler.  I don't have a running version of asl with me, but
I've been looking at the documentation in preparation for my return to
et-3400 civilization.

I'm back at home and hacking away on the serial downloader project.  I
rearranged the circuit a bit so that received characters issue an interrupt
that goes to the NMI on the ET-3400A.  I adjusted the program to match.
I was then playing around with asl's p2hex program to generate the files
suitable to download to the ET-3400A.  The p2hex program can produce Motorola
S records or Intel hex format.  Although I'm using a Motorola 6800, I planned
to use Intel hex format because it's simpler.  For example, the output of my
"countup" program the other day looks like this in S records:
</p>
<pre>
S0030000FC
S5030001FB
S12200004F9730973197329733DE3208DF32270801010101010120F1DE3008DF3020EACE
S5030001FB
S107003000000000C8
S9030000FC
</pre>
<p>
And this in Intel hex:
</p>
<pre>
:1F0000004F9730973197329733DE3208DF32270801010101010120F1DE3008DF3020EAD2
:0400300000000000CC
</pre>
<p>
It's just a colon, length, address, zero-byte, data, and checksum.  There's
too much additional junk I don't need in the S records format.
</p>
<p>
I started writing a parser for the Intel hex format in 6800 assembly language,
looking for digits, A-F, colons, keeping track of nybbles, byte counts, etc.
Things were going well but it didn't take too long before it was at 200 bytes.
And it's only about 1/2 done.  Well, I just don't have a whole lot of usable
memory in these things (197+256 bytes in the ET-3400, and an additional 512
bytes in the ET-3400A).  I don't want to spend that much of it on a downloader
for two reasons.  The downloader is the part that I have to key in manually
and it wouldn't leave much room for "real" programs.
</p>
<p>
I'm now thinking of going with a very simple downloader.  No parsing.  Just
grab sets of [address, count, data...]... I've got an 8-bit-clean serial
port, so it'll be two chars for address, one for count, and one each
for the data bytes.  It will require a preparation program on my iMac
development host, but that should be pretty easy.  This will have to be
tomorrow's goal.
</p>
<hr>
<h3>2011-01-22</h3>
<p>
I finished the simple downloader and it's working pretty well.  It sits in
memory and the NMI from the serial port invokes an interrupt service routine
(ISR) which reads address, length, and data bytes.  Then it repeats waiting
for another set of address, length, and data bytes.  The routine has to keep
a "state" byte to know where it is in the sequence so that when the ISR is
invoked again, it knows where it was in the sequence.
</p>
<p>
I use a couple assembler features.  The ENUM pseudo-op is a straightforward
method to assign constant values to symbols.  I also use a simple macro
called "irp" which iterates over parameters to generate some code.  Here's
the listing:

<p>
There are a few more efficiencies I could take with the state handling,
decrementing instead of comparing, etc.  I may do that, because this part
of the program needs to be keyed in manually, so every byte saved helps.
</p>
<p>
So, here's a little sample program copied verbatim from the Heathkit Manual
for the Microprocessor Trainer ET-3400 page 55.  It goes through a loop
displaying all the segments on the LEDs.  I've edited it so the syntax
matches my assembler, but other than that it is unmodified.

I wrote a program to convert this format into a file that has just address,
length, and data bytes in it.  I wrote it in C, which isn't the greatest
language for easy string manipulation, but it's the "hammer" I've got handy
in my toolbox.  If you want to look at it, it's called
<a href="ihextoxfr.c">ihextoxfr.c</a>.  Comments are pretty sparse at this
point, but it loops through the lines of the intel hex format, digesting
the ascii hex digits and figuring out their values.  Then for each line
it spits out the address, length, and data bytes in binary.  These will
be sent directly down the serial port to the ET-3400A.

Here's what the output of the ihex2xfr program looks like when shown through
hexdump.
</p>
<pre>
$ ihextoxfr &lt; sample1.hex &gt; sample1.xfr
$ hexdump sample1.xfr
0000000 00 00 10 bd fc bc 86 01 20 07 d6 f1 cb 10 d7 f1
0000010 48 bd fe 00 10 10 3a ce 2f 00 09 26 fd 16 5d 26
0000020 ec 86 01 de f0 8c 00 20 06 c1 0f 26 ea 20 da   
000002f
</pre>
<p>
So you can see the first line of intel hex has an address 0000, 10h bytes,
and then the data bytes starting with "bd" and ending with "fe".
</p>
<p>
This ".xfr" file is then sent down the serial port using the "Send Text"
mechanism of the Zterm serial program I'm using on the Mac.

<h3>2011-01-24</h3>
<p>
We've got a week left in the challenge.  It's time to start really doing
something!  Sure, I've got my ET-3400 and ET-3400A repaired and cleaned up.
I got a nice cross-development environment going on the ET-3400A.  Although
that seemed pretty cool to me because it will speed up my development, it
is not actually cool to anyone else, except maybe the random ET-3400 owner
who might wander by.  It's just an enabler for cool.  Real cool is still
to come, I hope.
</p>
<p>
With the remaining time, I would like to do at least one pure software
project on the ET-3400A.  I haven't decided what, yet, but I'm sure
something will come up.  However, with just over 300 bytes of ram to work
with, it will be a challenge.  I mistakenly thought that the ET-3400A had
more memory than the ET-3400.  This was a reasonable assumption, since the
ET-3400A has 2x 2114 static ram parts yielding 1k, whereas the ET-3400 has
4x 2112 static ram parts yielding 512 bytes.  Unfortunately, the ET-3400A
was designed to be an updated version of the ET-3400, so the upper half
of the 1k isn't available.  (I found this out <b>after</b> keying in
a program to 0x200, only to find it wasn't there.  A quick check of the
ET-3400A schematic and sure enough, the address logic is for 512 bytes
only, and A9 on the 2114's is grounded.)
</p>
<p>
I'd also like to do some nifty hardware things.  You might recall I mentioned
a HP 7475A plotter.  You might also recall that the transmit data line on my
6850 UART is inoperative.  I made several attempts to get it going yesterday,
but it just won't budge.  I'm pretty sure it's broken.  I could order a new
6850 off ebay or from Jameco or something like that, but it probably wouldn't
arrive in time unless I pay for expedited shipping.  I'm too cheap.  I will
probably order a replacement eventually, but after the winter warmup is over.
Currently, I do have a working "RTS" output line, so I could twiddle the
signal manually at the correct rate to transmit characters to the plotter.
</p>
<p>
I have also dug up an Optrex DMC-40218  2-line by 40-character LCD module
that I picked up about 20 years ago.  I had never tried to get it work
before, so I had no idea if it was functional or not.  Yesterday, I did
manage to find the operating instructions for it on the internet.  Today,
I rearranged my interface circuit a bit, checked to ensure the serial port
was still working, and then spent about 2 hours figuring out why the serial
port wasn't working anymore.  It turns out I had borked it yesterday with
my experiments to get the transmitter going.
</p>
<p>
Now that is all sorted out, the basic interface to the LCD seems to be
functional.  There's quite a bit of controlling to it, and I haven't
quite mastered it yet.  I did manage to get a "hello" to display
once simply by manually poking at the control and data registers, but
haven't done any programming to it yet.
</p>
<p>
Here's what it looks like:

I've got the LCD figured out.  You send various things to a control
register, then send the display data to the data register.  Once I
figured out the right bits to set in the control register, it came
together nicely.  There are some nifty features such as quickly scrolling
the characters on the display left or right.  There are also 8 loadable
character slots, so you can make your own character patterns.

<p>
After getting the LCD going and putting up the sample display, I realized
two things:
</p>
<p>
1) I don't like having the downloader running in the background.  Any time
I've got Zterm running on the Mac, if I accidentally hit some keys
in that program, they get sent to the ET-3400A and the downloader starts
interpreting them as address, length, etc.  Also, because the ISR had to
save the state of where in the byte stream it was, I was never sure that
it was in the proper state to just start using again (waiting for an address).
So I was often resetting and running the init routine in it anyway.
Additionally, I think I'd like to use the serial port to receive some data
other than downloaded code.  For instance, I can get keyboard input from my
Mac's keyboard to the ET-3400A over the serial port quite nicely.  So, I have
disabled the NMI from the serial port and now go with polling.  The program
doesn't have to keep track of downloading state, and the downloader is much
simpler now.  As an added bonus, when I have to key it in manually, it goes
quicker because it's shorter than before.
</p>

45 fewer bytes to key in.

<p>
2) I'm starting to feel confined in the mere 256+197 bytes of memory.  (59 bytes
are used by the monitor ROM.)  I wanted to do some animations on the LCD and
quickly ran out of memory when I was coding it.  I have therefore added to
my frankenstein mess and added 2K of memory.  I had four 2114 1k-by-4bit static
ram parts hanging around.  So, with more wire, a little more glue logic, and
those 2114's, I've got 2K more RAM.  It's contiguous, too, from 2800-2FFF.
If I do this 61439 more times, I'll have 120M,
just like the nice

I saw recently.
</p>
<p>
But seriously, 2k is really quite a luxury in this environment.  Here's a
picture of the monster in its current form:
</p>
<p>
<a href="memory.jpg"><img src="memory_sm.jpg" alt=""></a>
</p>
<p>
The memory board is at the top.  The ET-3400A is running a program that takes
keys over the serial port and dumps them to the LCD.  It shows the hex value of
the last key on the LEDs at the top.  Here's the code.  There are some extra
routines that are currently unused in this program.  That's not a problem now
since I've got all this memory and a nice downloader now!

Often when there's a bug in an ET-3400A program, the CPU gets loose and starts
executing random things as if they were code.  Sometimes when this happens,
everything in RAM gets overwritten.  That means that I have to key in the
downloader by hand again, re-download the offending code, and start debugging.
</p>
<p>
When this happened 3 or 4 times in about 10 minutes, I figured there had
to be a better way.  One solution is to put the downloader into EPROM and
wire it up.  Another is to make the downloader extremely simple.  I chose
the latter.  My simple downloader is 14 bytes long.  I then use this to
download the more complete downloader, which I've spiffed up to flash the
LEDs while things are downloading.  Then I download the real programs.

The real downloader's binary file needs to be modified a bit to strip off
the address and length bytes at the beginning, but that's done easily with:
</p>
<pre>
tail +4c /tmp/$1.xfr > $1.xfr
</pre>
<p>
The exciting news today is that I have a working serial output port.  You may
recall that the Tx line on my 6850 ACIA isn't functioning.  I also didn't have
the 1488 line driver to go with it.  However, I did find a Motorola MC145407P
single supply 3-in/3-out RS232 interface.  I got a couple sample parts about
25 years ago.  I think this was Mot's response to the Maxim MAX-232 devices.
It's one of those interfaces where you give it +5V, hook up some capacitors
and it uses charge pumps to produce its own +10V/-10V.  I didn't want to
put on the capacitors and since I have +12V/-12V supplies handy, I just
hooked those to the correct voltage pins.  The in and out drivers seem to
be working okay.
</p>
<p>
As far as the Tx line on the ACIA not working, that's a different problem.
I do have a functioning RTS line, so I figured I can just wiggle that line
at the right rate with the correct data to make my own serial port.  I
wrote up the code which rolls the bits out of one of the accumulators,
rolls each one into the other accumulator, moves it around and builds a
proper control word for the ACIA, spits it out, then waits for a time to
be determined so that it matches the right baud rate.  I tried it out with
a very long wait so I could watch it.  It seemed to have the bits all correct.
I then set out to calculate the delay to put in the bit loop to send bits
at 1/38400'th of a second.  I know the basic cycle time of the ET-3400A,
and how many cycles there were in the existing part of the bit loop.
</p>
<p>
It turned out that my machine is so slow, using this method I could not
get the bits out at 38400 baud!  I had to rearrange the routine so
that it prepares a list of the bytes to send to the ACIA's control port.
Then when it comes time to send the bits over the RTS line, I can run
through that list quickly.  There was enough time to spare so that 3 NOP
commands completed the loop for 38400 baud.  (I also added some
code so that I can output bytes at 9600 baud, which happens to be that
fastest speed of the the HP-7475A plotter that I intend to hook up.)
</p>
<p>
Here's the code for the serial output:

I've been able to do some things with the HP 7475A plotter by hooking it up
to the Mac and typing simple commands.  I'll be working on getting the
ET-3400A speaking its language tomorrow.  Here's a pic of it along with my
other trusty lab tech.
</p>

<h3>2011-01-31</h3>
<p>
The ET-3400A is now driving the HP 7475A Plotter!  I wanted to show a nice
simple picture and little bit of text, but not too much so that it wouldn't
take too long to plot.  I chose a
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110203114202/https://paleoferrosaurus.com/atom.jpg">nice design</a>
from
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130205010709/http://paleoferrosaurus.com/rcww2011.html">Paleoferrosaurus's 2011 Winter Warmup</a>
.  <i>(I'll try to keep these links updated as Paleoferrosaurus reorgs his
site after the challenge.)</i>
</p>
<p>
The ET-3400A doesn't have any BASIC, sine, cosine, or even floating point
capability.  I certainly wasn't going to be able to obtain or write fp
and trigonometric functions before the end of the challenge.  However, I
do have a pretty smart macro assembler that can do floating point and trig
functions.  Using looping macros and these functions, I was able to get
the assembler to generate a long table of vertices.  The structure of that
part of the program follows Paleoferrosaurus's BASIC program structure.
In the list of vertices, I place a special code to lift the pen at the
appropriate times.  The section of the program running through the list
looks for this code and does the right thing.
</p>
<p>
The HP 7475A plotter takes a series of 2-letter commands followed by numeric
parameters.  These are things like "PA1,1;" to move the pen, "PD;" to put the
pen down on the paper, and "PA1,255;" to drag the pen to a new position.  The
units of the plotter are tiny, .00098 of an inch.  However, it has built-in
scaling.  Since I wanted to work with single byte integers, I set up an area
on the page so that 0,0 is in the lower left corner and 255,255 is the upper
right.  The table of generated vertices has x and y values from 1 to 255, with
(128,128) being the center of the area.
</p>
<p>
Although my 6800 is pretty slow, the plotter is even slower.  The ET-3400A
can send data to the plotter faster than it can digest it and plot.  I used
the plotter's DTR (data terminal ready) signal to determine when it was ready
to receive more data.  This DTR line is fed into the CTS line on the 6850 ACIA,
and its status is checked before each byte is sent.
</p>
<p>
Here's the assembly program.  It's long and boring, but if you scroll to
the bottom you can see the bit of paleoferrosaurus's code.  I provided the
raw assembly here instead of the output listing file because that file is
pretty big.  The listing gets big because the looping macros are all unrolled.
However, it's cool to look at how the vertices are generated, so you can see
the listing <a href="plot.lst">here</a>.

The loops use "rept" instead of "while" because there's a bug in the
assembler and it wasn't ending the loops properly.

Here's the movie of it all in action:

Thank you, paleoferrosaurus, for the nice drawing.

Today is the last day of the challenge.  I had a blast and now I'm a bit sad
that it's come to the end.  I'll probably play with the ET-3400 and ET-3400A
trainers a bit more, but as with all these projects, it's difficult to make
the time to spend on them "now" when there's always "later".
</p>
<p>
I'll probably focus on gathering all the individual parts (ICs, resistors,
capacitors, etc.) from the EE-3401 and EE-3402 instructional courses and
restoring them back into complete kits.  There's also some scanning to do
to get the second of these courses online.  Plus the first course has an
audiotape and flipchart piece.  A friend of mine converted the audiotape
to CD last spring, so that's preserved, but the flipchart needs to be
scanned now.  Finally, I've got to find a good storage container for these
trainers so they don't get so dusty again!
</p>
<p>
Until next time!
