<h1>Welcome to gc.org</h1>
<p>
For many years, I didn't have a web page here.  I would get tons of inquiries
from people who would assume that since there was no web page, I wasn't using the
domain.  They would ask if I wanted to sell it.  I created a special page
just to answer this question:
<p>
<a href="notforsale.html">Is gc.org for sale?</a>
<p> The page is still accurate as of 2011.  If you are inquiring about gc.org,
please read it.
<p>
That was the main page here on gc.org for many years, but I've now decided
that I want to have a somewhat more friendly and useful main page.
