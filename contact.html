<h1>Contact Gilbert</h1>
<h4>Contact info:</h4>

<p>I'd love to hear from you.  My email address is simple, but you have to
solve a puzzle.  You can send email to me here:</p>
<pre>
    www.gc.org.YYYY@gc.org
</pre>
<p>Replace YYYY with the current year.  If that bounces, you might want to try
previous years instead.</p>
