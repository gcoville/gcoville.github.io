This page lists various projects and activities related to my experiments with
my Heathkit ET-3400 and ET-3400A microprocessor trainers.  If you're interested
in the ET-3400, be sure to look at my first link below, as there are plenty of
pictures and a couple videos of the ET-3400 and ET-3400A in action.

<h4 id="1hzmystery">1Hz mystery solved</h4>
<p>
<i>2011-02-03</i>
</p>
<p>
In the retrochallenge, I fixed the 1Hz signal for the ET-3400.  It needed a new
quad-comparator chip.  Originally, it was a LM2901N, but I replaced it with a
LM339.  The typical way to look at the output of a signal is to connect a wire
to one of the LED inputs.  When I did that, the period and duty cycle seemed
way off, 26 per minute and on for about 80%, off about 20%.  I noticed that
the same behavior on the ET-3400A, so I just ignored it for later.
</p>
<p>
It turns out the the issue here is a measurement problem.  The 1Hz signal uses
RC-based timing on the quad comparator.  The inputs to the LED have a 8200 ohm
pull-down resistor.  That affects the timing and duty cycle of the 1Hz signal.
If you take the output of the 1Hz signal, throw it into a TTL gate first, such
as a 7404 inverter, then look at the output, it's much closer to 1Hz.  I did
this and the frequency seems to be about 80 in 60 seconds, and very close to
50% duty cycle.  It's good for a nice slow pulse, but it's not good for
anything close to 1.0000 Hz.

<h4 id="newassembler">New version of the asl assembler</h4>
<p>
<i>2011-02-03</i>
</p>
<p>
In the retrochallenge, I found the asl assembler and compiled it on my Mac.
Overall, I'm extremely happy with this assembler.  It made my life much
easier while messing around with the ET-3400/ET-3400A.  It does have some
quirks, though.
</p>
<p>
The asl assembler is a C port of a Pascal program that the author did in the
mid '90s, I think.  It's all open source, however the code is a mess.
Perhaps if I look at it for a while longer I'll get used to it.  But because
it's a translation from an old Pascal program, there's stuff in there like
this:
</p>
<pre>
#define BEGIN {
#define END }

#define AND &&
#define OR ||
#define NOT !

#ifndef False
#define False 0
#define True 1
#endif

#define Nil NULL
</pre>
<p>
The code is littered with BEGIN and END, pascal style.  It's no longer
Pascal, and it's not C.  Ugh.  But it works quite well.
</p>
<p>
I still haven't gotten the listing control to work.  There's a command-line
switch to enable/disable various portions of the listing: turn on/off the
symbol section, line numbers, etc.  So far, nothing I've tried has had any
effect on the listing format.
</p>
<p>
For my final demo I used some of the macro looping features, and that's
when I ran into a real bug.  Look at this segment:

<p>
Excuse me?  Is that a "180" (31 38 30) there in my loop that was supposed
to end at 135?  It was this bug that caused me to use the "rept" macros
instead of the "while" macros in the final demo in the retrochallenge.
</p>
<p>
Early on in the retrochallenge when I found the asl assembler, there was
the "last stable" version and the current "beta" version.  I chose the last
stable version, v1.41r8, which according to the web page was released in 1999.
The last "current version" was listed as 2006, but the download page called
it beta, so I didn't want to mess with it at the time.  After the
retrochallenge was over, I decided to take a look at the current version,
and it turns out this software is still being actively developed.  Last
version was in December, 2010.  He's abandoned the versioning scheme he had
on the web page and just goes by beta build number.  Anyway, now that I'm
running the new version, you can see an improvement.

<p>
The loop stops at "135" (31 33 35) as it should.  I still haven't gotten the listing
control to behave as I expect, but I'm sure it's still just operator error.

<h4 id="lcdmonitor">Monitor using the LCD</h4>
<p>
<i>2011-02-02</i>
</p>
<p>
I've been thinking it would be cool do have the ROM monitor operate on the LCD
instead of the LEDs.  It could have the "CPU UP" and all that right on the
LCD.  I've started by getting the code for the ET-3400 Monitor Rom.  The
et-3400 yahoo group files section has it available.  With a few simple
modifications, it builds in the asl assembler.
</p>
<p>
The main issue is how to get to the "reset" entry point in my monitor?  It's
too early to remove the real rom monitor, so the ROM is still there and always
directs the Reset vector to $FC00.  There's nothing I can do about it.  However,
I can use the NMI signal as a sort of Reset to get into my own Monitor.
</p>
<p>
So I rebuilt the monitor with a new origin so that it runs in the additional
RAM I added during the retrochallenge.  I changed the "CPU UP" to be "cPU UP",
put a jump to reset vector into the place where the real rom monitor vectors
the NMI to, and hit the NMI button.  I got my "cPU UP", and everything else
worked just fine.
</p>
<p>
There is a problem, I've got an non-bounce-protected button going into the
NMI vector.  I'm pretty sure it's sending multiple NMIs to the CPU.  This
is not desirable.  I'll have to set up a debouncer on that button.
</p>
<p>
Next step is to gut the output routines that go to the LED and stick in some
LCD ones.
</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="nmidebounce">NMI Debounce</h4>
<p>
<i>2011-02-03</i>
</p>
<p>
I've got a button going into the NMI line.  It's pulled high, and the button
grounds it.  Well, this scheme sends multiple falling-edges into the NMI
line.  This is causing more than one interrupt.  I set up a simple counter to
see how many I was getting, and it was somewhere about 20 interrupts per
keypress.
</p>
<p>
There are several debouncing methods.  Since I don't have "software" as an
option here, I chose to use a 555 timer to send a one-shot pulse when I
hit the NMI button.  As long as I have released the nmi button before the
pulse is done, I don't get any bounces sent on the way up.
</p>
<p>
I'll post a schematic when I get a good method.

<h4 id="twooldboards">Ebay purchase: two old boards</h4>
<p>
<i>2011-02-03</i>
</p>
<p>
I bought two "for parts" ET-3400A boards off ebay.  They do not have the
blue-plastic cases.  From what I can tell of the pictures, they both have
all the keycaps, the RAM, CPUs, two 7-segment LEDs each.  Neither one
has the ROM.  There's only one power transformer.  I didn't pay much for
the lot.  It will be interesting to see what arrives and whether there's
any hope these can ever operate again in some form.
</p>
<p>
<i>2011-02-07</i>
</p>
<p>
The boards arrived today.  They don't seem to be in too bad shape.  Clearly,
they've been raided for parts.  I may be able to get them working.  The ROMs
are missing, so they need to be adapted for EPROM use which requires a
modification because the Motorola ROM pinout is not compatible with your
average 2716.
</p>
<p>
One has an LED missing, and the other has green LEDs where I usually
expect red ones.  Green power LED, too.  Plus a funny "* cancel" label
on the reset key.  Both have had their 7-segment LEDs raided.  And both
look like their dipswitches were actuated by pencil-point.  Perhaps these
were used in a teaching lab.  There's also only one transformer, which is
detached.  It's actually a transformer assembly, with the output wires
severed from the board, the power cord cut off, but the fuse circuit is
still there.  Most of the other chips are present.  Interesting is that
the CPUs are 6808's, whereas my reference ET-3400A has a 6802.  The 6808
has a little bit of built-in ram which is disabled by the ET-3400A, making
it behave just like a 6802.
</p>
<p>
I figure a good way to get started with these is to start grabbing the
components individually and testing them out in my working ET-3400A.  I'll
also need to make a power connector for them much like I did for the ET-3400
in the retrochallenge.  I'll check out basic power connections, then I guess
the acid test is to populate them with all known working parts and see how
it goes.  Then decide what to do from there.  I'll need a good mounting
solution at some point.
</p>
<p>
Another interesting thing is that to examine these boards, it's easier for
me to look at the hi-resolution photos than to actually go over to the boards
and stare at them.  The lighting with the camera flash is better than the
lighting in this room in general.  (Oh, now I see one of them is missing diode
D17 adjacent to the CPU.)

<p>
<i>2011-02-08</i>
</p>
<p>
I was looking in the "Motorola 8-bit Microprocessor and Peripheral Data" book,
and I was mistaken, the 6802 has the built-in RAM and the 6808 does not have
it.
</p>
<p>
Another thing I noticed is the 6802/6808 does not have the tri-state control
input.  I wonder how you're supposed to do DMA with these parts?  The
ET-3400A does have a TSC input, but it doesn't seem to do anything to the
CPU.  Heathkit might have faked it.  I'm not likely to be doing any DMA
with either of these boards, but it is a mystery.

<h4 id="retroschematics">Schematics for the additional circuits in the retrochallenge</h4>
<p>
<i>2011-02-06</i>
</p>
<p>
I wired up quite a bit of stuff to the ET-3400A during the retrochallenge,
and I only have vague sketchings of the schematics I used.  I should get
these posted before they leave my head or I have to tear the circuits apart.
</p>
<p>
I'll be looking for a suitable schematic capture tool, or maybe just a simple
drawing tool.
