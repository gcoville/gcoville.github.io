&nbsp;&nbsp;more KIM-1 noodling
</p>
<p>
In the RC2011 Summer Challenge, I had great visions of fixing a KIM-1 and then playing around on it. Well, the beast was in pretty bad shape and I only barely got it functioning at the 11th hour.
</p>
<p>
I did more repairs on it during the off-season, so that needs to be documented.
</p>
<p>
There are still more repairs I could do, but I could just blow those off and head straight for play time.
</p>
<p>
I'm thinking I'm going to be less focused during this challenge than in the past. Look out for some sidetracks.

<h3>2012-01-02</h3>
<p>
And we're off!  Yesterday I spent just a little bit of time getting my KIM-1
ready for the Retrochallenge.  Here's what it looks like:
</p>
<p>
<a href="kim-1_with_daughterboard.jpg"><img src="kim-1_with_daughterboard_sm.jpg" alt="A KIM-1 with some wires heading away from the connectors.  There is a homebrew daughter board hovering above one of sockets where there would be a RRIOT.  The other RRIOT socket is empty.  The seven-segment displays are bright and show 8003 00.  Two of the memory chips are not like the others and are in sockets."></a>
</p>
<p>
The upper connector with all the wires is the Expansion Connector.  My KIM-1
used to be dependent on external circuitry, but now it can operate standalone.
However, I do have some extra stuff hooked up at the moment, so the picture
shows it connected.
</p>
<p>
I made a video showing what my KIM-1 is like now:
</p>
<p>
<iframe title="KIM-1 6530 board" src="https://makertube.net/videos/embed/da05a23e-b514-4eaa-adf2-34d1c594e54d?warningTitle=0" allowfullscreen="" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0"></iframe>
</p>
<p>
I still need to figure out what to do with it.  I've got a few ideas.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Make a nicer 6530 replacement board
<ul>
<li>Add a second 6530 to replace the other missing RRIOT.</li>
<li>Board would sit in the sockets of both missing RRIOTs.  Note: those sockets are not perfectly aligned.  There's about 1/20 of an inch offset.</li>
<li>Maybe have it professionally made or etch it myself.  I'm definitely not going with wiring it like the current one.</li>
<li>A single 2716 EPROM (2k bytes) would cover the ROM needs of both 6530s
being replaced.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Get the analog section going
<ul>
<li>There's a missing capacitor</li>
<li>U26 is supposed to be a 7438 quad NAND w/ open-collector outputs, but there's a 7400 quad NAND ttl output sitting there.  That's not right.</li>
<li>Mess around with the save-to-audiotape and current-loop serial interface.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Wire in some more RAM and ROM
<ul>
<li>This is practically done already.  The RAM on the breadboard is 32k.  I just need to adjust the addressing logic.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Write some 6502 code, or steal and adapt something already written.
<ul>
<li>I think it would be cool to get a BASIC going on there</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I don't intend to accomplish everything on the above list.  It's just a list
of things I'm thinking about.
</p>
<hr>
<h3>2012-01-03</h3>
<p>
Today I cleaned up the breadboard a bit and added 32k of RAM.
</p>
<p>
The KIM-1 has a memory map that looks like this:
</p>
<pre>
0000-0400	1k onboard static RAM
1700-173F	I/O + Timer from RRIOT U3
1740-177F	I/O + Timer from RRIOT U2
1780-17BF	64 bytes RAM in RRIOT U3
17C0-17FF	64 bytes RAM in RRIOT U2
1800-1BFF	1k ROM in RRIOT U3
1C00-1FFF	1k ROM in RRIOT U2
</pre>
<p>
However, the 6502 CPU is looking for three 2-byte vectors at FFFA, including
the Reset vector.  It turns out that the upper three address lines, A13-A15,
are not used at all on the board, so the above map is duplicated 8 times at 0,
2000, 4000, ... , E000.  The ROM at 1800-1FFF also appears at F800-FFFF.
That's how the CPU resets and interrupts properly.
</p>
<p>
The main address decoding in the KIM-1 can be enabled or disabled by external
circuitry.  That signal is called DECEN and is the third wire that I'm using on
the lower Application connector.  If that line is grounded, the KIM-1's address
decoding is normal, and everything's repeated 8 times.
It's pretty much required to have some RAM at 0-FF for 6502 page 0 addressing
and 100-1FF for 6502 stack.
Therefore, a common configuration is to enable the DECEN signal only when the
upper 3 address lines are either 000 or 111.  The KIM-1's onboard peripherals
then occupy 0-1FFF and E000-FFFF.  This way you can have your RAM at 0 to cover
pages 0-1 (and 2-3), and also have your ROM at FFFF for the vectors.
This scheme leaves 2000-DFFF available to for other uses.
</p>
<p>
I've got a 32k static RAM part on my breadboard.  Up until now, I've limited it
to only 1k by grounding its 5 high order address lines.  I'd now like to make
the full 32k available for programs.  Since it's RAM, I'd like it to be at the
bottom half of the 64k address space.  That's going to collide with the 0-1FFF
location of the KIM-1's peripherals.
</p>
<p>
To get around this, I made it so the the DECEN line is only enabled for the
E000-FFFF case.  The RAM on the breadboard is located at 0-7FFF.  The
only problem here is that the KIM-1's firmware is targetted to run at 1800 and
expects to see its I/O at 1740.  Therefore, I modified the KIM-1's monitor to
use the I/O at F740 and run in the F800-FFFF range instead.  Being able to make
these sorts of firmware changes is a nice benefit of having the KIM-1's monitor
in EPROM instead of mask-programmed in the RRIOTs.
</p>
<p>
This is working just fine.  One thing I'll have to be careful about is using
example KIM-1 programs from "The First Book of KIM" (or elsewhere).  Those
programs make calls to subroutines in the KIM-1 monitor.  I'll need to adjust
those subroutine calls for my relocated ROM location.
</p>
<p>
Here's my current memory map:
</p>
<pre>
0000-7FFF	32k static RAM on breadboard
8000-9FFF	(empty)
A000-BFFF	6532 RIOT on the breadboard
C000-DFFF	EPROM on the breadboard
E000-E400	1k static RAM on the KIM-1
F700-F73F*	I/O + Timer from RRIOT U3
F740-F77F	I/O + Timer from RRIOT U2
F780-F7BF*	64 bytes RAM in RRIOT U3
F7C0-F7FF	64 bytes RAM in RRIOT U2
F800-FBFF*	1k ROM in RRIOT U3
FC00-FFFF	1k ROM in RRIOT U2	- 1/2 the 2716 on the daughterboard
</pre>
<p>
I've put "*" by some of the addresses because my board doesn't actually have
a U3 RRIOT (or replacement board) installed.  Yet.

<h3>2012-01-23</h3>
<p>
Well, I finally got some time to work on my project.  I have decided to get Lee
Davison's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130308145900/http://mycorner.no-ip.org/6502/ehbasic/index.html">Enhanced 6502 BASIC
(EhBASIC)</a> going on the KIM-1.
</p>
<p>
The requirements of EhBASIC are relatively simple.  The documentation states
that it requires 10k for the interpreter and anywhere from 1k to 48k RAM to
hold BASIC programs.  EhBASIC communicates to the world entirely through six
system routines: Input, Output, Load, Save, Irq, Nmi.  Irq and Nmi are optional,
and I can stub out Load and Save to being with.  For Input and Output, I'll
be using a serial port.
</p>
<p>
Up until now, I'd been connecting 2716 EPROMs to the KIM-1.  They hold 2k bytes.
In order to be able to hold 10k, I'd need to bump up to 16k.  A 27128 holds 16k,
but I've got some 27256 parts which hold 32k.  I've wired in a 27256 into the
circuit, but disabled the upper half.  I've also added a serial port using a
Motorola 6850 ACIA.  (The circuit is quite similar to my ACIA circuit from
<a href="/rc2011ww/">last year</a>, except I'm using a 10Mhz clock oscillator
and dividing by 16 externally using a 74193 counter and another 16 inside the
6850.  10Mhz / 256 = 39062.25 bits/sec, which is close enough to 38400 baud
to work.)
</p>
<p>
First sidetrack: My workspace had become quite a mess while I was developing
the 6530 replacement board and I couldn't find my 6850 parts.  I had purchased
a couple pieces about a year ago and I knew they were on the desk somewhere.
I had dozens of little tubes and anti-static foam pieces holding a variety of
chips.  The anti-static foam deteriorates after about 20 years, so I finally
coalesced much of the collection to one larger anti-static pad:
</p>
<p>
<a href="chips.jpg"><img src="chips_sm.jpg" alt="An antistatic pad with a whole array of vintage CPUs, TTL, and EPROMS in it."></a>
</p>
<p>
For the big chips, you can see several 8048 series parts, a z80a, four 6530
RRIOTs, three 6840 timer parts, some 6820/6821s PIA parts, an AY-5-1013A UART,
an 1802 cpu, an 8031 cpu, a 6532 RIOT, a 8073 SC/MP w/ BASIC, a 6502, a
6801 cpu, a Signetics 2650 CPU, four 8086 cpus, and a 8060D SC/MP cpu.  I've
also got quite a few EPROMs to play with, most of them are 2716 parts, but
there are a few others, including the 27256s I'll be using to put EhBASIC into.
</p>
<p>
And here's a picture of the external circuit now:
</p>
<p>
<a href="serial_port_and_eprom.jpg"><img src="serial_port_and_eprom_sm.jpg" alt="A Heathkit Breadboard unit with some circuitry on it.  Clearly identifiable is an EPROM, some static RAM, and a UART with a crystal oscillator."></a>
</p>
<p>
To the left is the serial port.  The EPROM there is a 27256 with half disabled.
</p>
<p>
Next step is to start working with the EhBASIC source code, get it to build
w/ my assembler, and write up the minimal routines to make it go.
</p>

<h3>2012-01-29</h3>
<p>
Today I got <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130308145900/http://mycorner.no-ip.org/6502/ehbasic/index.html">EhBASIC v2.22</a>
running on my KIM-1!
</p>
<p>
EhBASIC v2.22 source comes as a zip file containing <b>readme.txt</b>,
<b>basic.asm</b>, and <b>min_mon.asm</b>.  The <b>readme.txt</b> doesn't have
anything useful in it.
<b>min_mon.asm</b> is a very small 6502 monitor.
It handles the reset/irq/nmi vectors, simulated
serial IO, and invoking the BASIC cold-start or warm-start entry points.
<b>min_mon.asm</b> includes <b>basic.asm</b> which contains the bulk of EhBASIC.
</p>
<p>
The code is written for the TASM assembler.  My preferred assembler is
<a href="http://john.ccac.rwth-aachen.de:8000/as/">asl</a>.  There are some
syntax difference between the two assemblers.  The first step was to convert
the source files from TASM to asl syntax.  Some pseudo-ops are different.
The way to specify the high or low 8 bits of a 16-bit constant and
the ability to use square brackets in arithmetic are also different.
</p>
<pre>
TASM		asl (in 6502 mode)
----------------------------------
.include	include
.byte		fcb
.word		fdb
*=		org
#&lt;value		#lo(value)
#&gt;value		#hi(value)
[]		()
</pre>
<p>
Since there were about 800 places to edit for these changes, I made a little
<a href="convert.sed">sed script</a> to do the conversion.  The sed script
isn't robust enough to fix every possible situation of the above syntax
differences, but it does cover all the ones present in EhBASIC's asm files.
</p>
<p>
After that, the <a href="diff-basic.asm-1.txt">changes to <b>basic.asm</b></a>
were minor.  Just two places reflecting the different memory map of my
environment.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="diff-min_mon.asm-1.txt">changes to <b>min_mon.asm</b></a> were
not too bad.  This is where I put the interface to my serial port.  I also
removed min_mon's owning of the 6502 reset/irq/nmi vectors.  I'll be
keeping the KIM-1 firmware in place and simply invoking this min_mon by hand.
</p>
<p>
I assembled it, burned it to a 27256 EPROM, and put it into the circuit.  I
then instructed the KIM-1 to execute at B000, and it worked first time!
</p>
<p>
Here's a screenshot of my zterm window:
</p>
<p>
<img src="ehbasic-1to10.png" alt="A screenshot of a terminal emulator.  On the screen is 6502 EhBASIC [C]/old/[W]arm ?   Memory size ? $8000  31999 Bytes free  Enhanced BASIC 2.22     Ready   10 FOR i=1 TO 10   20 PRINT i;    30 NEXT i   Ready   RUN    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10    Ready">
<br>
EhBASIC has the ability to do a warm start and retain the program and data from
the previous run.  If you're running in BASIC the whole time, control-c will
interrupt the program.  But if the BASIC program calls out to an assembly
function which never returns and you have to reset the computer, a warm start
will get you back into EhBASIC without re-initializing the environment.  This
assumes that EhBASIC's internal variables in page 0 and elsewhere haven't been
scribbled on.  Right now, I think the KIM-1's ROM monitor may be conflicting
with EhBASIC, so I'm reluctant to rely on the warm-start.  If this is the
case, it's a fairly straight-forward process to move the EhBASIC variables
to new places to not conflict with the KIM-1's page 0 usage.
</p>
<hr>
<h3>2012-01-31</h3>
<p>
I've had a chance to play with EhBASIC a bit.  It's really quite a robust
BASIC environment.  It's well suited for dedicated 6502-based embedded
systems.  There are plenty of ways to deploy and invoke 6502 machine code,
directly access memory and I/O devices, and handle IRQ and NMI interrupts in
BASIC itself.
</p>
<p>
And so here we are again, at the end of another retrochallenge.  I got a nifty
computing environment set up, but didn't have much time to play with it.  I
expect I'll be messing around with it all for several more months.  There's
lots of fun ahead making BASIC routines to interface with the various bits of
KIM-1 I/O, ie. the keypad and LED displays.  That should keep me busy.
</p>
<p>
Until next time!
