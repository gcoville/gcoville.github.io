<h2>Description:</h2>
This page describes my efforts to restore a Commodore KIM-1 single board
computer.
<p>
This is part of the

Retrochallenge 2011 Summer Challenge</a>
that occured from July 1, 2011 to July 31, 2011.  The Retrochallenges are
designed to get retrocomputing enthusiasts to actually spend time doing
what they like to do: mess about with old computers.
<p>
My project won first place.  My prize was a vintage Amstrad NC200 Notebook
Computer with users manual and leatherette case.  It's quite nice and I look
forward to playing with it.
Second place went to
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130115111723/http://whats.all.this.brouhaha.com/2011/07/06/retrochallenge-2011-project/">
brouhaha</a>
who recognized that the original Apple 1 was designed to have either a 6800 or
a 6502, but nobody ever put a 6800 in one.  He converted the Apple 1's 6502
monitor program to 6800 code and got it going with the MESS simulator.  He
contributed his work back to the MESS project, so everyone can have it now
which is quite cool.
He finished that early in the challenge, so continued some work on a HP-41
replica platform he's been working on.  His prize was the book "Micro-Computer
Technology" by Julian R Ullman, Professor of computer science at Sheffield
University, 1982.
Third place went to
<a href="http://aliennerd.wordpress.com/">Aliennerd</a>, who did some
amazing things with an Epson PX-8 laptop, including devising a way to send
Twitter tweets from it.   His prizes were the books "Weird Computer Games"
(Usborne computer books) by Jenny Tyler and C. Oxlade, 1984 and
"The Pre-Computer Book" by F A Wilson, 1983. 
<p>
There were lots of other cool projects and I suggest you check out the
Retrochallenge page and take a look.

The contest runs from July 1, 2011 through July 31, 2011.  I'll post more info
on this project once the contest begins.

<h3>2011-07-01</h3>
<p>
Well, here we are at the beginning of the Retrochallenge 2011 Summer Challenge.
I wasn't sure if I'd enter the contest because I'll be out of town for about
two weeks in the middle of the month.  I chose to restore this KIM-1 because I
figure I'll need to order some parts for it.  Maybe I can time things so
that I'm away when I'd wouldn't have been able to do anything except wait for
the parts to arrive.  Another reason I chose to restore the KIM-1 is that two
other contestants in the challenge are doing things with KIM-1 or the more
modern MicroKim.  Maybe if I can actually get this thing running, they'll
already have written cool software I can steal.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  :-)
<p>
Working KIM-1 boards seem to go for between $200 and $400 on ebay.  That's quite
a lot of dough for a very simple computer.  However they're fairly rare, so
that's the going rate.  I bought mine for far less than that, but it's going to
need some work.  Here's a pic: <em>(click on the image for a much
higher-resolution version)</em>
<p>
<a name="initialpic">
<a href="unhappy_kim-1.jpg"><img src="unhappy_kim-1_sm.jpg"></a>
<p>
It appears to be a Commodore MOS KIM-1 Rev D, SN #2177 (I think that's a SN)
<p>
Here are some of the problems I see right away:
<ul>
<li>One of the 6530 PIO/RAM/ROM chips is missing.  Uhoh.</li>
<li>There's been some sort of abuse in the LED display area.
<ul>
<li>All the transistors are bent over</li>
<li>Three of the 7-segment displays are missing</li>
<li>The first two 7-segment displays have gashes in them</li>
<li>Where the third 7-segment display would be, there's a metal trace that's
become separated from the surface of the PCB</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There's a component missing in the analog area, about 1 cm below the
variable resistor.  I'm not sure what it is.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The missing display and analog components don't worry me too much.  I'll be
able to find suitable replacements easily enough.
<p>
The missing 6530 is quite worrisome though.  This part has a mask ROM in it
made especially for the KIM-1.  Any similar parts are most likely already in
running vintage KIM-1 boards.  There are two of these parts on each board, and
they have different ROM contents.  I don't know which one is missing and whether
the board can operate without it.  Initially, I'm not interested in getting
the tape audio circuit or current loop interface working, so maybe there's
enough firmware in the first ROM to operate the keyboard and displays.
<p>
There's plenty of KIM-1 documentation on the Internet, so researching this
shouldn't be too bad.
<hr>
<h3>2011-07-03</h3>
<p>
Unlike most of my retrocomputing, I never used the KIM-1 "back in the day".
Therefore I've had to do quite a bit of research and learning.  There is a
tremendous wealth of information about the KIM-1 on the internet.  One site
really stands out:
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110709042310/http://users.telenet.be/kim1-6502/">
Erik Van den Broeck's KIM-1 page</a>.
He has converted the KIM-1 Hardware, Software, and Users manuals to HTML.
They're beautiful, searchable, and quite understandable.  
<p>
Another great site is Ruud Baltissen's
<a href="http://www.6502.org/trainers/buildkim/buildkim.htm">
Build your own KIM-1</a>.  There's a schematic of the original KIM-1,
a discussion of how to work around the impossible-to-find 6530 RRIOT parts
using a 6532 RIOT and EPROM, and a schematic of a replica KIM-1 with the
workaround.
<p>
The part that I'm missing is the 6530-002 RRIOT (ROM-RAM-IO-Timer) chip.  This
isn't going to be easy to find.  I have put out a call to the vintage computer
community to see if anyone has one knocking around, but the sad fact is it's
just not likely there are any spares out there.  Most likely, I'll have to
implement a workaround.  The problem with the 6532-based workaround in Ruud's
page is that the 6532 has a vastly different pinout than the 6530.  Implementing
that will require making a translation board.  That's not completely out of
the question, but it is a bit cumbersome.
<p>
Ebay does have some 6530 parts listed.  It is highly unlikely that these will
be the exact part I need.  Most likely they'll have different ROM contents.
I've been thinking that I could use a different 6530, disable the ROM function, and piggyback an EPROM part.
<p>
Another wrinkle is that even with different ROM contents, the 6530 had 0, 1,
or 2 chip select pins taken from two of the IO pins.  This was configurable
when the customer ordered the part from MOS when they provided the ROM
content.  The 6530-002 I'm looking for has one chip select, and therefore is
missing its PB6 line.  This is probably a common configuration, so I just might
go ahead and buy a few old 6530s and see what I get.
<p>
As for the 7-segment LEDs, I've been thinking I'll yank out what's there,
put in low profile sockets, and put in all new displays.  However, when I
turned the board over I saw that one of the displays was already desoldered,
yet it won't come out!  It appears there's still some solder on the top side
of the board holding the pins in.  Probably whoever attempted this previously
on this board pulled the display out anyway, and that's why one of the traces
on the top of the board is detached.  I'll have to figure out a better way to
get these displays removed.
<p>
I did straighten out the transistors.  Luckily, all the legs appear to be
intact and not touching each other.
<p>
<a href="righted_transistors.jpg"><img src="righted_transistors_sm.jpg"></a>
<p>
The shadow from the flash in the picture above shows the trace that's hovering
above the PCB.
<p>
Finally, I've been looking at Briel Computers
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110822170108/http://www.brielcomputers.com/micro-KIM.html">Micro-KIM</a>.
I'm secretly toying with putting the KIM-1 aside, spending the $150 for a
fully-assembled Micro-KIM, and getting on with life.  :-)

<h3>2011-07-05</h3>
After more research, it looks like it's not so simple to find a different 6530,
hope it has the desired chip selects, and defeat the ROM.  Another
mask-programmable aspect of the 6530 is the actual addressing of the IO and
RAM within the 6530's address space.  This was implemented so that a designer
could have multiple 6530s in a system with minimal glue logic.  They'd just
need to order their 6530s so that they didn't have any addresses in common
and wire them essentially in parallel.  It's really a very cool idea.  It's
just too bad they didn't make a one-time-programmable version of the part.
<p>
So, the likelihood that going out and buying some random old 6530 and having it
be useful is low.  Therefore, I'm now planning to make a 6530 module out of a
6532, EPROM, and a little glue logic.  It will be an ugly little riser card.
You've been warned.
<p>
Today I got a bit sidetracked (and a bit poorer) buying NS 32k components.
Perhaps that's for some future retrochallenge.
<p>
And I've still got my eye on that Micro-KIM.

<h3>2011-07-19</h3>
I've been out of town and away from my toys for a while now.  Last week I was
holed up in a hotel in Salt Lake City doing my regular job.  I am a full-time
telecommuter.  Had I not told them, I don't think anyone I work with would have
known I wasn't at home.  This week has been vacation, but pretty much every
day has a more grueling hike than the previous.  I live close to sea-level,
and most of these hikes have been above 8000 ft (~2500 m).  Here's a shot of
the GPS as we started a hike one day.
<p>
<a href="gps_elevation.jpg"><img src="gps_elevation_sm.jpg"></a>
<p>
(10416 ft = 3189 m)
<p>
Note the white background in the picture.  That's snow.  Even though it's
summertime here, we've been hiking through quite a bit of the stuff.
<p>
Back to retrochallenge.  Even though I'm not at home where my project is,
many of the tasks ahead are things I could theoretically do while I'm away.
<ul>
<li>Study up on the 6530 that I'm replacing</li>
<li>Study up on the 6532 that I'll be replacing it with</li>
<li>Come up with a rough design of the board to do the replacing</li>
<li>Order the parts for the 6530 replacement board and the seven-segment LEDs</li>
</ul>
<p>
If I can get these parts ordered and have them arrive at my home early next
week, I'll have one last week to assemble the 6530-replacement board and
install the new LEDs.
<p>
The only problem is that at this altitude my brain isn't quite capable of
focussing on the task.
<hr>
<h3>2011-07-21</h3>
I ordered a bunch of parts for the project.  My hope is that they'll arrive
on Monday.  I'll be getting two 6532s, seven 7-segment LED displays, and a bunch
of IC sockets (for the RIOT, EPROM, as-yet unspecified glue logic, and the
LED displays on the KIM-1 itself).  Except for particularly expensive parts, I
like to get an extra one of each item.  That way I don't have to worry too much
if I fry something during soldering, break a pin plugging something in, or
accidentally swap Vcc and Gnd.
<p>
Some of the 40-pin sockets are wire-wrap sockets.  Even though the legs will
be soldered to the home-brew daughter board, the long legs will extend down
to the main KIM-1 board.  There are more professional ways of doing this, but
I've used wire-wrap sockets in the past for this and it worked well.
<p>
I also remembered to order two edge connectors that will fit the KIM-1.
That's the proper way to power the board, plus there's a line called DECEN
that needs to be connected to ground or the chip selects for the peripherals
on the board won't work right.  (The purpose of the signal is that if you add
external circuitry, you can fine-tune the KIM-1's onboard address decoding.)
<p>
I've also been reading up on the 6530 RRIOT and the 6532 RIOT.  One of the
projects to build a KIM-1-like computer with 6532s, large SRAM and standard
EPROM shows how to do the address decoding for these things, but it's in the
context of the overall address space.  My project will be using the existing
chip selects and decoding for the non-existent 6530, so my glue logic has to
do everything relative to how the KIM-1 sees the single 6530-002 part.  It's
a subtle difference.  I haven't worked out the details yet.
<p>
My current plan is to replace the LED displays first, then rig up a protoboard
to the 6530-002's socket so I can try out my replacement circuit before
committing it to a soldered circuit board.
<hr>
<h3>2011-07-26</h3>
The parts arrived.  I ordered from
<a href="http://www.jameco.com/">Jameco Electronics</a>
in Belmont, CA because they had the 6532s.  Actually, the parts shipped Friday
and arrived Saturday, before I even got home from vacation.  It really was a
blast from the past to order from them because I used to buy the exact same
kinds of stuff (sockets, leds, chips, etc.) from them 25 years ago when I was
in college.
<p>
Change in plans, again.  I was thinking why start out trying to recreate the
6530 on a daughter card?  I should really test the existing parts on the KIM-1
before proceeding.  There's a 6502 CPU, a 6530-003, 1K SRAM, some LEDs and
the keypad.  I plan to use the KIM-1's Application and Expansion connectors
to get at the signals so that I can put in a custom EPROM with a modified
version of the KIM-1's monitor program.  I can make it so the ROM is at the
high end of the address space where the reset vector is.  At the same time,
I'll make it so that the KIM-1's regular address decoding is limited to the
bottom 8k.  Of the two 6530s, the one that's missing is the one that connects
to the keyboard and LEDs.  I'll have to borrow the one 6530 I do have and put
it into the socket that connects to the keyboard and LEDs.  The 64 bytes of
RAM in it, IO, and timer will not be at the addresses where the original
monitor firmware expects them, so I'll have to modify the firmware a bit in
my custom KIM EPROM.
<p>
I should probably start out with a simple program that just tests the 6502
to see if it's at least operating, then test the SRAM, then test the 6530-003
sitting in the 6530-002's socket, then test the keypad and LED displays.
<p>
This is a lot of EPROM burning and erasing, so I figured it was time to dust
off my old EPROM programmer.  It's a B&C Microsystems 1409C that I built
back in 1986.  Here's a picture of one I pulled off the web:
<p>
<img src="bc_microsystems_1409c_web.jpg">
<p>
Unfortunately, this is what mine looks like:
<p>
<a href="bc_microsystems_1409c_eprom_burner.jpg"><img src="bc_microsystems_1409c_eprom_burner_sm.jpg"></a>
<p>
The builtin eprom eraser (lower left) is removed to make room for a custom
hack board I added to the programmer in 1988 (according to my notes).  I added
a 6116 RAM by piggybacking off the EPROM socket inside the programmer itself
(much like I plan to do with the KIM-1 here in July 2011!)  I'm not quite sure
why I did this hack, but I think I had a grandiose plan to rewrite the 8085
firmware in the programmer and add the capability to program more devices.
That project is unfinished, but at least the programmer is in an operable state.
<p>
Before moving on, note the wirewrap socket jammed into the KIM-1's 6530-002
socket.  That's probably how my daughter card will ride on the KIM-1
eventually.  Plus I've got an edge connector attached to the upper expansion
connector.
<p>
Here's a better view of the hack board inside the EPROM programmer:
<p>
<a href="bc_microsystems_1409c_hacked.jpg"><img src="bc_microsystems_1409c_hacked_sm.jpg"></a>
<p>
From left to right, the EPROM holding firmware which I think I downloaded from
B&C in the early '90s, the empty wirewrap socket that connects to the lower
firmware socket, and the 6116 SRAM.
<p>
Anyway, it appears to be able to read 2716's I've got hanging around, some of
which are already erased.
<p>
Here's a picture of my homebrew EPROM eraser, made from raw materials:
<ul>
<li>An EPROM eraser board removed from a B&C Microsystems EPROM programmer</li>
<li>A random cardboard shipping box that will seal nicely to keep the UV inside</li>
<li>Some cardboard packing material formed to hold the board up</li>
<li>Power cord cut off from some dead electronic thing I pulled from my to-take-to-the-ewaste-site pile</li>
<li>Wire nuts</li>
</ul>
<a href="homebrew_eprom_eraser.jpg"><img src="homebrew_eprom_eraser_sm.jpg"></a>
<p>
There's also an EPROM there right under the bulb ready to be erased.
<p>
Tomorrow, I hope to attach an EPROM to the KIM-1 and write some programs to test
things out.
<hr>
<h3>2011-07-27</h3>
I cracked out the Heathkit ET-3300 breadboard and power supply.  I'll use
this for my prototyping with the KIM-1.  I also wired up the KIM-1's
Application Connector.  That was easy because I needed only 3 wires.  I've
started the Expansion Connection, but that one will need about 30 wires.
<p>
<a href="et-3300_and_kim-1.jpg"><img src="et-3300_and_kim-1_sm.jpg"></a>
<p>
The circuit to add the EPROM will be very simple.  I hope to have it wired up
tomorrow.

<h3>2011-07-29</h3>
Today I've been writing tons of little programs to test things on the KIM-1
board.  Results have been somewhat troubling.
<p>
However, I'll start with a success.  I took the original KIM-1 source
listing, converted it to syntax that my assembler, "asl", understands, and
was able to assemble it.  I verified that the resulting output matches ROM
images of 6530-002 and 6530-003 that I found on the web.  This is useful
because one of my tests was to modify this code for various different
addresses, such as the ROM itself residing at f800 and the 6530-003 (which
I do have) sitting in the socket for the 6530-002 (which I don't have).
I actually did try that experiment and it did not work.  I then went back
to the little tests to see what's working on the board.
<p>
I got somewhat hung up on testing the 1K of RAM on the KIM-1 board.  My first
ramtest program indicated there was a failure somewhere in the RAM.  Remember,
I still don't have a whole lot of output at my disposal, so I'm still
indicating various bits of status by pinging select lines on a 3-to-8 decoder
and looking at them with a logic probe.
<p>
By modifying the ramtest program, I found that page 0 (0000-00ff) and page 1
(0100-01ff) test fine, but pages 2 and 3 do not.  This is somewhat good news
because page 0 is important in 6502 code to keep various values and pointers.
Page 1 is where the stack is, and is critical for operation if you're going
to do anything with subroutines (which is pretty much required for anything
one would want to do with a microcomputer).  So, it's good news that page 0
and page 1 are okay and the faults are in page 2 and page 3.  What's not
good is that all these addresses are served by 1024x1 static ram parts.
So if there's a fault in one of the ram chips, that chip actually serves
one bit of all the addresses in the first 1k.  Faults might show up in page
0 and page 1 any time now.  It took several versions of the ramtest program
to narrow this down to the page granularity.
<p>
I also attempted to test the 6530-003 part that I have sitting in the U3
socket.  (I'm missing -002.  I got confused in yesterday's video about which
one I'm missing.)  The 6530 has RAM, ROM, IO, and a Timer.  I started by
testing the 64 bytes of RAM, and that gives a failure.  Ugh.  Either the
part is bad, or I've gotten confused on what addresses it should be at.
The test didn't proceed to the ROM test or IO test, and I've run out of
time for today.
<p>
Here's a picture of my work area.
<p>
<a href="lots_of_eproms.jpg"><img src="lots_of_eproms_sm.jpg"></a>
<p>
Note the large number of EPROMS that have been burned.  It's a good thing
that I've been hoarding 2716's for the past 30 years.  Also note that I have
a ZIF (zero-insertion-force) socket on the breadboard.  It's been really nice
having that there while I'm swapping all these EPROMs in and out.

<h3>2011-07-30</h3>
There is so much that doesn't seem to work on the board, I thought that I might
have power problems.  I checked some voltages on the board and they did seem
a bit low at 4.75 volts.  I'm now using a beefier power supply (from an old
AT-style computer) and the voltages are a bit better.  Unfortunately, none
of the problems magically disappeared as I was hoping.  I'll keep the bigger
power supply in place until I get all the problems figured out, then go back
to the lesser supply and see if things still work.
<p>
I think the one 6530 that I do have isn't any good.  No amount of prodding
has gotten any signs of life out of it.  I'm not quite ready to give up on
it yet, but I have put it aside.  That's a 6530-003, which doesn't do much
for the actual operation of an unexpanded KIM-1, except hold half the ROM
monitor.  It's the 6530-002 in location U2 (the lower one in the pictures)
which I need replicate.
<p>
Today I wired up a 6532 RIOT (ie. no on-chip ROM) into the circuit and put it
at address 2000h.  I've got its IO lines going straight to the appropriate
places on the U2 socket so it should be able to control the LED displays
and get data from the keypad.  I modified the KIM-1 ROM monitor program
with the new addresses of the IO ports, onchip RAM, and location of my
EPROM to see if I can get the KIM-1 display and keypad functioning.  I
still haven't fixed all the LED displays, but I figured I should be able
to at least see the ones there that are working show something.
<p>
<a href="6532.jpg"><img src="6532_sm.jpg"></a>
<p>
It partially works, I can see the initial display of a "0", but it's not
responding to my keypresses.  I suspect that the SRAM at pages 0 and 1 is
not healthy enough to actually support the ROM monitor.
<p>
Tomorrow I'll wire up some replacement RAM at low memory and evaluate where
to go from there.

<h3>2011-07-31</h3>
This is the last day of the retrochallenge and it sure has been a busy day
here.  But at the end ... WE HAVE A WORKING KIM-1!
<p>
I started off the day by adding a static RAM part to the proto board.  When
that was put in place at address 0, the KIM monitor started behaving.
<p>
Then I started replacing the displays.  I used 14-pin IC sockets, because I
wasn't sure if I'd ordered the right parts, and I didn't want to have to do
any more desoldering than necessary.  It turns out this was a good decision,
as I did in fact order the wrong displays.  The pinout was all wrong.  I didn't
know they came like that, but I do now.  After an emergency run to Fry's, I
came home with the right parts.  Here's a picure of the new displays in action.
<p>
<a name="newdisplays">
<a href="pretty_new_displays.jpg"><img src="pretty_new_displays_sm.jpg"></a>
<p>
I spent quite a bit of time trying to figure out what was wrong with the
KIM-1's onboard RAM.  I found a memory test program in
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110709042310/http://users.telenet.be/kim1-6502/6502/fbok.html">
The First Book of KIM</a>
that worked quite well at exercising the RAM enough to fail.  A few mods
to the program and I was able to determine exactly which bit was failing.
The KIM-1's SRAM is made up of eight 1024x1bit 2102 SRAM parts.  Determining
which bit then leads me to which actual IC is faulty.  I found out that it
is bit#1, represented by the 2102 at location U11.  I do plan to replace it,
but I ran out of time.  (As it happens, I have a stash of 2102s that I've been
carrying around since I was about 11 years old.  They were part of a Signetics
2650 project that didn't go anywhere.)
<p>
However, the KIM-1 is quite functional for doing KIM-1-like activities.  I
whipped up a little program that counts up and shows the value on the LED
displays.
<p>
Here's a video showing today's activities plus the program counting up.

<p>
And here's the counting program:

      22/      18 :                     
</pre>
Note that the scands subroutine's address is different than what the regular
KIM-1 (or MicroKIM) user would expect.  This is due to the fact that the
my KIM-1 ROM has been reassembled to run at a different location than the
stock KIM-1 ROM.
<p>
And that's it for my 2011 RetroChallenge entry.  I'm quite proud to have this
project to the point where I have a working KIM-1 given the setbacks: a
missing RRIOT, a faulty RRIOT, faulty RAM, and the abuse in the LED displays
area.  I think I'll still go ahead and make the daughter card so that this
KIM-1 can operate with the stock KIM-1 firmware and without the assistance
of the protoboard.  But for now, I've got enough KIM-1 to play around with.
<p>
Have a good summer, folks!  See you next year.
